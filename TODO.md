# Dashboard Alignment Task - COMPLETED

## Summary of Changes Made:
1. **Created student dashboard routes** (`backend/routes/studentDashboard.js`)
2. **Implemented student dashboard controllers** in `backend/controllers/dashboardController.js`
3. **Mounted student dashboard routes** in `backend/server.js` at `/api/student/dashboard`
4. **Fixed frontend time formatting error** in `UpcomingClasses.tsx` with try-catch
5. **Updated mock data** to use proper ISO date strings for date/time fields

## API Endpoints Now Available:
- `GET /api/student/dashboard/stats` - Student dashboard statistics
- `GET /api/student/dashboard/upcoming-classes` - Upcoming classes with limit
- `GET /api/student/dashboard/assignments` - Pending assignments with status filter
- `GET /api/student/dashboard/recent-grades` - Recent grades with limit

## Issues Resolved:
- ✅ Fixed 404 Not Found errors for student dashboard API calls
- ✅ Fixed "Invalid time value" RangeError in UpcomingClasses component
- ✅ Aligned frontend API calls with backend routes
- ✅ Ensured data consistency between frontend expectations and backend responses

## Next Steps:
- Test the dashboard in browser to verify all components load correctly
- Consider implementing real database queries instead of mock data
- Add proper authentication/authorization for student dashboard endpoints
