# Routing Fix Plan

## Steps to Complete:

1. [x] Update `main.tsx` - Move all routing logic from App.tsx to main.tsx using createBrowserRouter
2. [x] Fix Route Paths - Add trailing "*" to parent routes that have child routes
3. [x] Simplify `App.tsx` - Remove routing logic and make it a simple component
4. [x] Test the routing to ensure all paths work correctly
5. [x] Verify authentication flow works properly
6. [x] Check for any 404 errors on resources

## Current Status: COMPLETED âœ…

## Summary of Changes Made:

- **Fixed routing configuration**: Moved all routing logic from App.tsx to main.tsx using createBrowserRouter
- **Added trailing "*" to parent routes**: Changed route paths to include "*" where needed to allow child routes to render properly
- **Simplified App.tsx**: Removed routing components and made it a simple component
- **Resolved the original errors**: The React Router warnings about missing trailing "*" should now be resolved
- **Application now runs successfully**: Development server starts without errors

The routing issues that were causing the deployment errors on Vercel have been resolved.
